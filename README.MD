<ul>
	<li>	<h5> First part of project: Webcrawler </h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Data is scraped using a starter link through which further links and data is collected from. The library used to web scrape was Requests and BeautifulSoup. The data from 		    each website is stored in text files. The stored data is then cleaned using Regex, NLTK tools, and basic python functions. </p></li>
	<li> 	<h5> Second part of project: Chatbot </h5>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowledge based was created based on different type of data (tables, dictionaries, text) into variables. Information retrieval methods using cosine similarity, and few hardcoded 		responses were done manually. Chatbot asks for user data to remember and respond accordingly. Flow of conversation and accuracy of data retrieved was substantially accurate. </p> </li>
