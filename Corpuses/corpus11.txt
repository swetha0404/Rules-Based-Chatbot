What?’” Tilly, 61, said the American Heart Association’s  Go Red for Women  Red Dress Collection on Wednesday night. “She was so cool I thought she was a lesbian. ”  In November, Reeves, 55, and Grant, 46, were  seen holding hands  at the Lacma Art + Film Gala, and instantly sparked romance rumors. “I t’s really astonishing to me how in the last five months, all of a sudden, she goes to an event with him and everybody goes insane,  like, ‘It’s his new girlfriend,’ because she had gone to a lot of events with him,” Tilly said. “It’s just suddenly surfaced that he’s been dating her for several years. The “Child’s Play” star, who met Grant at a dinner party years ago, raved that the “brilliant artist” is perfect for Reeves because they are very similar. “I saw him at her last art opening, and he’s not, like, wanting the spotlight, because he’s a really low-key guy, too, and I think why everybody went crazy is that they’re sort of the perfect couple,” Tilly said. “I think everybody wishes that they had something like that. It’s not a razzle dazzle Hollywood romance. ”  The actress shared that Grant — who is still a bit of a mystery to the public — is  a “cool, elegant woman — very quiet, very low-key. ”  She added, “[Reeves] is a really great guy, too, but he’s really lucky. ”  When asked whether she thinks her pals will tie the knot someday, Tilly responded, “ I don’t know that doesn’t seem very hip and bohemian, does it? They’re artists. They’re just going to do what they do. How much are tickets?  Micky Dolenz of the Monkees is on tour in 2023.
