As a matter of fact, he found the  Sad Keanu meme  funny. That’s what he told  Reddit in a two-and-a-half hour AMA  (ask me anything) done in connection with promotion for his upcoming directorial debut  of Tai Chi Man of Tai Chi , which opens Nov 1. He wanted to make it clear that he’s not, in fact, sad: “I think that a picture can tell a thousand words, and none of them can be right. Or true. I’m absolutely a very happy person. I always thought it would be cool to play for the Canadian Olympic team. When I was 15, I decided to become an actor. ” Keanu, who is 49, is, of course known for playing Neo in the  Matrix  movies, for  Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure , for  Speed ,  My Own Private Idaho ,  Point Break ,  The Replacements ,  A Scanner Darkly  and the much-maligned  Constantine. (For the record, I love that movie and I don’t care who knows it. So I hope that at its core that we came across to the people who love the original. ” He also says he kept Constantine lighter. As for upcoming projects, this one sounds intriguing: “I’ve got a project that I’ve been developing for over six or seven years. It’s a role I am looking forward to playing, it’s called  Passengers. And in that film I play a character named Jim, who wakes up on a spaceship with five other people planning to homestead. He wakes up too soon, ninety years before arriving. What does he do?” Asked about his musical tastes he mentions Nine Inch Nails and Toronto  punk band Metz , the members of which are probably about to enjoy some newfound fame. I really used to love hanging out by the grade school I used to go to, I played a lot of street hockey and basketball there. We had wonderful parks, Ramsden Park, we had chestnut fights running around Ramsden Park. The Bloor Street Cinema , I would go see movies there. The University Cinema. ” He asked how he manages to stay grounded, being famous and all: “. The ground is very close. And we walk on it every day. ” (There is so much more in this pretty damned great AMA, that you should definitely go read the whole thing). Pressed on how he keeps looking so young, he denies having a fountain of youth and says, “Yeah, for me that’s something inherited I guess. How does that happen? I don’t know. I haven't done anything in particular, I will just go with genetics. I will just thank my mom and dad and then their parents and then their parents. ” And, answering the question, “How do you think your life would be different if you had chosen the ‘blue pill’?”: “I think if I had taken the blue pill, it says I would go back to sleep and I would have never known what was happening. Which sounds very depressing. So I’m glad I took the right pill. ”                                  MaleneArpe  worked as a reporter at the Toronto Star from 2000 to2015.
